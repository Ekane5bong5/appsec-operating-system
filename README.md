# AppSec Operating System

This repository documents a structured Application Security mastery program focused on **engineering judgment**, not tool usage.

The goal is to develop the skills expected of senior AppSec engineers at high-bar organizations.

## What This Is

This is **not**:
- A collection of random vulnerability labs
- A cheat sheet repo
- A bug bounty write-up dump

This **is**:
- A daily execution system (4 hours/day)
- A growing portfolio of AppSec reasoning artifacts
- A record of how vulnerabilities are created, missed, and prevented
- Evidence of secure code review literacy and real-world AppSec judgment
